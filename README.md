# Heart-Diseases-prediction

# Overview

This repository contains a project focused on heart disease prediction. The data, derived from heart patients, includes various health metrics such as age, blood pressure, heart rate, and more. The primary objective is to create a predictive model that accurately identifies individuals at risk of heart disease. The emphasis is on achieving a high recall to ensure no potential heart disease case is missed.


# Problem
In this project, we delve into a dataset encapsulating various health metrics from heart patients, including age, blood pressure, heart rate, and more. Our goal is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately identifying individuals with heart disease. Given the grave implications of missing a positive diagnosis, our primary emphasis is on ensuring that the model identifies all potential patients, making recall for the positive class a crucial metric.


# Objectives

The objectives of the project are as follows:

Data Understanding: Familiarize ourselves with the dataset and its features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Unveil patterns, trends, and relationships between different variables.
Univariate Analysis
Bivariate Analysis
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for future machine learning tasks.
Remove irrelevant features
Address missing values
Treat outliers
Encode categorical variables
Transform skewed features to achieve normal-like distributions
Model Building: Develop and refine the prediction models.
Establish pipelines for models that require scaling
Implement and tune classification models including KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
Emphasize achieving high recall for class 1, ensuring comprehensive identification of heart patients
Evaluate and Compare Model Performance: Utilize precision, recall, and F1-score to gauge models' effectiveness.
