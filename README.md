# Heart-Diseases-prediction

# Overview

This repository contains a project focused on heart disease prediction. The data, derived from heart patients, includes various health metrics such as age, blood pressure, heart rate, and more. The primary objective is to create a predictive model that accurately identifies individuals at risk of heart disease. The emphasis is on achieving a high recall to ensure no potential heart disease case is missed.


# Problem
In this project, we delve into a dataset encapsulating various health metrics from heart patients, including age, blood pressure, heart rate, and more. Our goal is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately identifying individuals with heart disease. Given the grave implications of missing a positive diagnosis, our primary emphasis is on ensuring that the model identifies all potential patients, making recall for the positive class a crucial metric.
